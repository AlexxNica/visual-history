# Visual History

Modern browsers lose rich information when they compress browsing history into a linear stack, which makes backtracking from a forrest of links surprisingly difficult. Visual History augments browser navigation in a way that is both quick, reliable, and predictable for power users, and also beautiful and intuitive for beginners.

Visual History is a Chrome extension that delinearizes your browsing history with a richer alternative to the Back and Forward buttons. Instead of a stack of previously visited destinations, Visual History maintains the forrest of trees that represent each tabâ€™s path around the internet, and lets the user easily backtrack to any site they recently visited.

Routes that normally have to be manually re-traced by users, like jumping between search results or forum posts, can now be intuitively and quickly directed without revisiting the parent page.
