Modern browsers lose rich information when they compress browsing history into a linear stack, which makes backtracking from a forrest of links surprisingly difficult. Visual History augments browser navigation in a way that is both quick, reliable, and predictable for power users, and also beautiful and intuitive for beginners.

Visual History is a Chrome extension that delinearizes your browsing history with a richer alternative to the Back and Forward buttons. Instead of a stack of previously visited destinations, Visual History maintains the forrest of trees that represent each tabâ€™s path around the internet, and lets the user easily backtrack to any site they recently visited. Routes that normally have to be manually re-traced by users, like jumping between search results or forum posts, can now be intuitively and quickly directed without revisiting the parent page. Power users can use keyboard shortcuts to quickly navigate around the graph.
